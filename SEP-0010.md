# Introduction
Although standards exist (e.g. the FITS standard) to describe metadata in data
files, it is not un-common for data sources to not comply with these standards.
This SEP lays out how sunpy core should behave when it loads data with
non-standards-compliant metadata.

# Detailed Description

## Proposal
This SEP proposes the following process for handling metadata:

1. Generic data loaders

The sunpy core package contains base types for storing data, e.g. GenericMap,
GenericTimeseries. Trying to load data that is not standards compliant with
these types should raise an error as soon as possible in the data loading
process. This allows users and developers to be easily notified of non-compliant
metadata, and follows a fail fast approach.

2. Source specific loaders

Data from a specific source (usually a specific instrument) may be associated
with its own sub-class of the base data storage types. These sub-classes may modify the
metadata to make it standards compliant, before the metadata is validated. This
allows fixes to be made for source-specific errors, which can be
common and unlikely to be fixed retrospectively by the data provider, especially for legacy
datasets.

The modification may be done in one of the following two ways:

- If standards compliant metadata can be created with cross reference to
  pre-existing metadata, this may be done without informing the end-user.
  A message must be logged to the sunpy logger at the debug level.
- If it is not possible to cross-check the creation of new metadata against
  pre-existing metadata, fixes and additions may still be made. A warning
  must be raised to inform the user of the assumption being made.

At the time of writing, sunpy core holds a number of these source specific loaders in
sunpy.map.sources. Whether these should be part of sunpy core or not is a
discussion beyond the scope of this SEP.

## Retaining original metadata

This SEP also proposes that in all cases an immutable copy of the original
metadata is retained. If desired, this allows the user to directly see
any modifications that have been made to the original metadata.

## Summary

- Generic data loaders should **error** on non-compliant metadata
- Source specific loaders can
  - Fix metadata with cross checks on pre-existing metadata, send a message to the debug **log**.
  - **Warn** the user and fix metadata without cross checks
- A copy of the original metadata should be retained at all times

# Decision Rationale
